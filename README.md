ebml-go // ebml
===============

Package `ebml` provides an implementation of an EBML decoder in the Go Programming Language.

EBML is short for Extensible Binary Meta Language.
EBML specifies a binary and octet (byte) aligned format inspired by the principle of XML.
EBML itself is a generalized description of the technique of binary markup.
Like XML, it is completely agnostic to any data that it might contain.
For a specification, see [http://ebml.sourceforge.net/specs/](http://ebml.sourceforge.net/specs/).
